## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **Course Detail Page** from the provided Figma design using **React**. The page includes various sections such as a header, course information, mentor details, lesson list, similar courses, and a footer. Your task is to break down the design into reusable components, style them, and ensure the page works correctly.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** and **npm** (to manage dependencies and run the project)
- **Git** (to manage version control and push your code to a repository)
- **Text Editor** (such as Visual Studio Code)

---

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Analyze the Design

Start by reviewing the Figma design. Identify the different sections on the page and think about how they can be broken down into smaller, reusable components.

- What are the key sections? (e.g., Header, Course Info, Mentor Info, Lessons, Footer)
- What elements are repeated, and what can be reused in other parts of the project? 
- Look at typography, spacing, and colors—these will inform your styling.

### 2. Set Up the Project Environment

Once you've reviewed the design, it's time to set up the development environment.

- Use **Create React App** to scaffold the project:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app your-project-name
  cd your-project-name
- Install any additional dependencies needed (e.g., for styling or state management). We will use default styling for now, but in later stages, you might need tools like Styled Components or Sass.

### 3. Plan the Folder Structure
Planning your folder structure is essential for organizing your code and making it maintainable. Here's a suggested structure:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Header.js
│   ├── CourseInfoCard.js
│   ├── MentorSection.js
│   ├── LessonsSection.js
│   ├── SimilarCourses.js
│   ├── NewsletterSignup.js
│   └── Footer.js
├── styles/
│   ├── index.css
│   └── components.css
└── App.js
```
### 4. Break the Design into Components

Now that you have a basic understanding of the project structure, start breaking the design into components:

- Header: Contains the navigation bar, logo, and search bar.
- Course Info: Displays the course title, price, rating, and course details.
- Mentor Section: Displays mentor's name, bio, and photo.
- Lessons Section: Contains the list of lessons for the course.
- Similar Courses: Displays other courses similar to the current one.
- Newsletter Signup: Allows users to subscribe to a newsletter.
- Footer: Contains navigation links and other essential information.

### 5. Develop Each Component

Start by building each component individually. Focus on the HTML structure first, then gradually apply styling:

- Hardcode the data in each component initially. Later, you can make the data dynamic (e.g., fetching course info from an API).
- For each component, think about reusability. If you see a pattern (e.g., similar layout for multiple courses), create a reusable component.

### 6. Style the Components

After building the structure of each component, apply CSS styling:

- Use CSS Flexbox or Grid to align elements as per the design.
- Add margins, padding, and typography styles based on the Figma design.
- Use a separate styles/ folder to organize your CSS files.
- Consider creating a theme for consistent colors, font sizes, etc., across the project.

### 7. Add Interactivity with State

Once the basic components and styling are in place, make the page interactive:

- Use React State to manage any dynamic data.
- Example: Track the lesson a user clicks on or whether they've subscribed to the newsletter.
- You can start with hardcoded data but eventually replace it with API calls to fetch real data if needed.

### 8. Test Your Project

Testing is an essential part of development:

- Run the app frequently while building to check that everything works as expected.

  ```bash
  npm start

- Ensure that the page is responsive (check the design at various screen sizes) and that all components look like the Figma design.
- Test any interactivity, such as button clicks, forms, etc.

### 9. Push the Code to GitHub

Once you are satisfied with your project, push your code to GitHub for version control:

- **Initialize Git**:
   ```bash
   git init

- **Stage and commit your changes:**
```
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
- **Push to a remote GitHub repository:**
  - If you haven’t created a remote repository yet, go to GitHub and create one.
  - Add the remote link to your local project:
```
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin master
```
This will push all your changes to the master branch of your GitHub repository, making your project available for future collaboration or updates.

### Conclusion
Congrats on starting your first frontend project! Remember, breaking down designs into components and developing them step-by-step will help you stay organized and efficient. If you ever feel stuck, refer back to this guide, and don't hesitate to ask for help. Happy coding!
